# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a college inquiry chatbot application with a conversational interface that answers questions about admissions, courses, campus life, fees, scholarships, and other college information using a local question-answer matching system.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a chat interface with message history, input field, and send button
- Create backend data structure with comprehensive college information (admissions, courses, facilities, deadlines, fees, scholarships, contact info, FAQs)
- Implement intelligent question-answer matching system that analyzes user questions and retrieves relevant responses from the college database
- Connect frontend and backend to enable real-time question processing and response display
- Design warm, academic visual theme using earth tones (greens, browns, creams) with modern typography and clean layouts

**User-visible outcome:** Users can interact with a chatbot through a conversational interface to ask questions about the college and receive immediate, relevant answers about admissions, programs, campus facilities, costs, and other college information in a welcoming, professionally designed educational environment.
